// built-in directives I've used:
    - ng-app
    - ng-show
    - ng-hide
    - ng-repeat
    - ng-view
    - ng-model
    - ng-controller
    
// if we were to put the ng-repeat directive on the 'ul' element instead of the 'li' element, the browser would read the html and create an unordered list from each name in the array
