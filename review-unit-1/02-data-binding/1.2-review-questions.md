// ng-model:
    - ng-model is a directive that binds/connects a form control to a specific scope property in the controller
    
// dirty-checking:
    - an angular digest loop that explicitly tells Angular to scan the scope for variable changes in each iteration of the loop, without calling $scope.$digest() -- which does the same thing even more explicitly
    
// {{}} expressions:
    - Angular expressions are JS-like code snippets that are placed in bindings {{}}, and are not Handlebars
    
// two-way data-binding:
    - if a variable changes in the controller, it also changes in the view. If a variable changes in the view, it also changes in the controller
