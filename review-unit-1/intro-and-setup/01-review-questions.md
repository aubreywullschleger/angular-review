// reasons to lean AngularJS:
    - larger community
    - more complete (has all MVC pieces)
    
// AngularJS complaints: 
    - poor documentation 
    - steep learning curve
    - hard to switch to a different framework/tool, not abstracted enough, rewrites are likely in the future
    
// is AngularJS an MVC framework?
    - sort-of, it's an MVC based framework, MVW(hatever), meaning  the C/controller piece can be Angular controllers, and/or custom services you're using
    
// ng-app:
    - it's a directive that connects your app (model/controllers) to your view (a specific piece of html, usually on <html> tag)
    - ng stands for AngularJS
