// Angular expressions:
    - JS-like code snippets usually placed in bindings {{}}
    - the 'tags' from other templating engines (ex: {{}} -handlebars, {} -mustache, etc) are the same thing as Angular expressions
 
// invalid code in Angular expressions:
    - if you write invalid code in an expression, the expression doesn't get interpolated 
    - if you write invalid code in an expression you will get a syntax parsing error
    
// Angular filters:
    - an Angular filter selects a subset of items from an array and returns it as a new array (kind of like .map)
    - an Angular filter formats the value of an expression for display to the user
    - examples of filters: currency, uppercase, lowercase, date
    - filter syntax: {{expression | filter}}
    - more than one filter can be used per expression using the pipe (|) to chain filters together
    - an example use case for a custom filter is to filter valid images by checking their extension (by writing your own js code to check image file extensions (using regular expressions))
